They can also borrow money from the central bank for up to 90 days.\\n- The ultra-low interest rates are expected to remain until the U.S. economy recovers from the coronavirus downturn.\\n- President Trump has been urging the Fed to take more action, including making the nation\\'s interest rates negative, which Powell said was unlikely to happen.\\n- The Fed had already implemented an emergency interest rate cut on March 3 and provided a $1.5 trillion injection into the bond market last week to ensure sufficient liquidity.', source='https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-zero-part-wide-ranging-emergency-intervention/')]"
