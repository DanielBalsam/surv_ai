However, the supply cap was later abolished to encourage its use and discourage hodling.\n",

However, this surge seems to be linked to a banking crisis that could cause a massive Federal Reserve earthquake, according to technology investor Balaji Srinivasan. He advises people to buy bitcoin now and get their coins off exchanges, while warning that the banking system is lying about solvency. This suggests that the recent surge in Bitcoin's price may not be sustainable and may be driven by fear rather than real demand for the asset.\n",

The article suggests that the decoupling of Bitcoin from traditional markets has been confirmed, and Bitcoin traders are anticipating the reversal of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, which is considered bullish for risk assets. However, the fear of stagflation could be behind the decoupling, and recent economic data has displayed moderate resilience, which may not be enough to sustain a continued upward trend in Bitcoin's price.\n",

While there are some bullish sentiments surrounding Bitcoin's price, the overall trajectory is uncertain. The prediction made by the machine learning algorithm in the Finbold article may have already been surpassed, but there is no indication of Bitcoin's current market price. Balaji Srinivasan's bold prediction of Bitcoin's price reaching $1 million within 90 days has not come true, and there is no evidence of a recent banking crisis that could spark hyperinflation in the US. Gareth Soloway's concerns about Bitcoin's value decreasing in 2023 cannot be ignored, as he points to significant factors such as a potential stock market sell-off and the increasing stability of the financial system. While Markus Thielen's insights in the Forbes article suggest that Bitcoin may benefit from government-guaranteed deposit insurance, falling inflation, and regulatory overhang, it is unclear whether these factors will have a significant impact on Bitcoin's price within the next 30 days. Therefore, I am more persuaded by the argument that the price of Bitcoin is more likely to be false.\u001b[0m\n",
